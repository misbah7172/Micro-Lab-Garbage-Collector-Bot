## üì± Mobile Responsiveness

The dashboard automatically adapts to different screen sizes:
- **Desktop**: Full 3-column layout with all panels visible
- **Tablet**: 2-column layout with camera panel spanning full width
- **Mobile**: Single column stacked layout for optimal mobile viewing

## üîí Security Features

- **PyTorch model loading** with trusted source handling
- **CORS protection** for cross-origin requests
- **Input validation** for robot commands
- **Error handling** and graceful degradation

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Camera Issues
- Ensure camera is connected and not being used by other applications
- Check camera permissions in Windows settings
- Try changing camera index in code if multiple cameras are connected

### ESP32 Connection Issues
- Verify ESP32 is connected via USB
- Check COM port assignment in Device Manager
- Ensure ESP32 drivers are installed (CH340 or CP210x)

### Model Loading Issues
- Verify `best.pt` file exists in the Final-Model directory
- Check PyTorch installation and compatibility
- Ensure sufficient system memory for model loading

### Network Issues
- Verify port 5000 is not blocked by firewall
- Check if another application is using port 5000
- Try accessing via `127.0.0.1:5000` instead of `localhost:5000`
